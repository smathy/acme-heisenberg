# Acme::Heisenberg

When you're ready to live in more of an uncertain world.  Just require this
module, and when you observe true or false values then their values might
change.

## Installation

Install it with:

    $ gem install acme-heisenberg

## Usage

    [1] pry(main)> require 'acme/heisenberg'
    => false
    [2] pry(main)> 1==1
    => false
    [3] pry(main)> 1==1
    => false
    [4] pry(main)> 1==1
    => false
    [5] pry(main)> 1==1
    => true
    [6] pry(main)> 1==1
    => false
    [7] pry(main)> 1==1
    => true
    [8] pry(main)> 

Perhaps the most surprising is that only the observation of the boolean is
affected:

    [9] pry(main)> b = 1==1; puts "Outputs: #{b}" if b
    Outputs: false
    => nil
    [10] pry(main)> b = 1==1; puts "Outputs: #{b}" if b
    Outputs: true
    => nil

So the boolean still operates as if it's true, even though when you look at it
it can be either true or false.  Holy Schr√∂dinger's Cat!
